A voice-first AI assistant that helps users design and build web applications through natural conversation. Simply describe your app idea by speaking, and watch as the AI generates a complete, professionally designed web application with real-time visual progress feedback.

## 🌟 Latest Enhancements

### **🧠 Enhanced AI Interaction**
- **Problem-Focused AI**: The AI now acts as an innovative problem-solving partner that challenges your assumptions and pushes for breakthrough solutions

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Voice not working?**
- Check microphone permissions in your browser
- Ensure you're using HTTPS or localhost
- Verify Deepgram API key is set correctly

**AI not challenging assumptions?**
- Ensure OpenAI API key is valid and has GPT-5 access
- Check that the enhanced system prompts are loaded correctly
- Verify the ideation agent is using the GPT-5 configuration

**Progress bar not updating?**
- Check WebSocket connection in browser developer tools
- Verify progress events are being sent from the backend
- Ensure the progress multiplier is configured correctly (10x)

**Code generation failing?**
- Verify OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Check console logs for detailed error messages
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Verify YAML processing is working in the background

**Preview not loading?**
- Check if port 4000+ is available for generated apps
- Look for build errors in the generation logs
- Verify the generated package.json has correct dependencies

## 🔄 Alternative Setup: Using Claude Codegen

By default, VocalFlow uses OpenAI GPT-5 for code generation. If you prefer Anthropic Claude instead, switch as follows:

### **Prerequisites for Claude Setup**
- Anthropic API key with Claude Sonnet access

### **Environment Variables**
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

### **Code Generation Changes**
Change the import and call in `agents/codeGen.ts`:
```typescript
// Change from:
import { runOpenAICodegen } from '../utils/openaiCodegen';

// To:
import { runClaudeCodegen } from '../utils/claudeCodegen';
```

Then update the function call:
```typescript
// Change from:
const result = await runOpenAICodegen(yamlPrompt, sessionId, events);

// To:
const result = await runClaudeCodegen(yamlPrompt, sessionId, events);
```

### **Performance Notes**
- GPT-5 offers unified model usage for both voice and codegen
- Claude Sonnet remains a solid alternative depending on preferences and cost
